Both fighting for top of their class they became academic rivals and then after nights of studying they fell in love and started to dream of their little restaurant together. Later after college they saved and saved and then they opened Kasama. They open the restaurant with the hope to use their shared heritage and create a restaurant that was circled around the love they had for their culture and each other. And they did. Every dish is inspired by some personal part of their life. Just come and enjoy a taste of home.</h2>
